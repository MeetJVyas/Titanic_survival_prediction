# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Using_Logistic_Regression
In this project, I am using Logistic Regression to predict the survival of titanic.

Project Description:
In this particular project, I am using a dataset that contains information like, Passengerid, Survived,pclass, sex, Age, sibsp, parch, ticket, fare, cabin, embarked.
and using that data to predict the survived passengers. 
However, first pre-processing the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
In addition, trying various techniques in order to gain the best accuracy in your predictions.
